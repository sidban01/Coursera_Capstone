As per Wikipedia, California has the highest population of Indian-Americans in the United States of America, of which San Francisco has the highest number of Indians living in the city. Thus, it is an interesting prospect to open an Indian restaurant keeping in mind the high number of Indian population living there. In this analysis, I have attempted to analyze the best possible location to open an Indian restaurant in San Francisco. I have made use of the Foursquare API to explore neighborhoods in San Francisco City. I used the explore function based on a search criteria to search Indian restaurants in the city. Finally, I used the Folium library to visualize the neighborhoods in San Francisco City and their emerging clusters. This should help understand whether it would be a good idea to set up in a high or low concentrated place with Indian restaurants nearby other Indian restaurants keeping in mind competition from similar cuisine restaurant. Simultaneously, I have made use of San Francisco Crimes data obtained from the various Police Departments within the city and converted the addresses into their equivalent latitude and longitude values. The subsequent sections describe in detail my work as below.
